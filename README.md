**Intro**

Through this project, I dove right into the world of APIs. Specifically, I began to use the fetch() method in JavaScript to be able to get, patch, post, and delete from an API. Moreover, through the use of the fetch() method, my web application now functions similarly to how you would expect a social media application to function; making my project come alive!

**Description**

I was tasked with providing functionality to the end user on my web application through a handful of uses of JavaScript's fetch() method. The end user's name and description, the cards displayed, the likes on a car, and even the avatar of the web application are all from the API. I created an API class, then implemented the class throughout index.JS, the JavaScript file responsible for interconnecting all of the classes I created, in such a way that the end user of my web application can update the information in the API. Through updating the information in the API, the end user is able to update the avatar picture, update the name and description, create cards, like a picture, and delete a card, which all users on my web aplication will see.
