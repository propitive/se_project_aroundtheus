**Intro**

Through this project, I dove right into creating responsive websites. Because of my decision to use grid and flexbox displays when possible, the scalability of my project and working through different resolutions was as smooth as butter! Additionally, I am familiarizing myself with JavaScript and its simple functionalities to give my web page's elements dynamic uses.

**Description**

I was tasked with creating a website that would test my ability to use media queries and grid layouts. The grid layouts turned out to go hand-in-hand with creating a responsive wedsite. I found the 'auto-fit' keyword to be particularly useful. Additionally, media queries ensured that minor, yet impactful, changes were able to be implemented as the screen size shrunk and grew. All in all, this was a fun, challenging project that made me truly appreciate all the scalable websites. 

I also began to use JavaScript to be able to do simple things like open and close modals. In my most recent project, I learned how to validate forms using JavaScript, which reveals an error message specific to the input field(s) that are invalid. Moreover, when an input field is incorrect, its respective modal button is disabled.
